# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Disabled RAW auto-brightening in the full demosaic fallback so monochrome and high-key RAW previews no longer render overexposed and drag learned-IQA scores down.
- Fixed 16-bit grayscale TIFF preview generation so scanned black-and-white images are rescaled to 8-bit tones before JPEG preview export instead of clipping nearly everything to white.
- Reset the review browser back to page 1 after a fresh Analyze run so returning to Review always starts from the beginning of the new result set.
- Clamped review pagination after delete and move operations so counts, page position, and current selection stay in sync when the result set shrinks.
- Switched delete, export/move, and cache-clear actions to async operation jobs with progress reporting and cancellation support in the busy overlay.
- Shortened RAW preview quality option labels so the Auto description fits cleanly inside the selector on tighter layouts.
